# NZLabShiny

The aim is to model NZ society with an emphasis on the impact of
personal and household resources in helping individuals to achieve 
valued social goals such as doing well at school, getting a job, 
and enjoying a good standard of living.

To do this, we construct a dynamic discrete-time microsimulation model 
of the NZ population over the period 1981 to 2006, using NZ Longitudinal 
Census data (produced by Statistics NZ) as the source for a starting sample
as well as for statistical estimation to inform subsequent simulation. 
Supplementary official data are used to account for population changes over time."),

This computer model (constituting a ‘social laboratory’) can then be used to 
undertake projections - what would NZ look like in the future? - and scenario 
testing - what if features of NZ society were different or were changed somehow? 
These virtual experiments can address real questions of either scientific or 
policy significance. 

We ask such pertinent questions here in a series of scenarios the results for 
which can be interrogated and visualised via this Shiny app, an accompaniment to
our book “Simulating Societal Change - Counterfactual Modelling for Social and 
Policy Inquiry” (Springer).
